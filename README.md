# standards

Constants and functions that are standard to MTCC and that can be used across different applications to achieve consistency.

### Installation

```sh
npm i https://github.com/MTCC-Plc/standards#{hash of the commit}
```

Unlike a regular install from the npm registry, this package will be fetched from github.

In order to pin to a specific version, the hash of the commit should be passed at the end of the url. If unsure which commit to use, pick the latest one. For example:

```sh
npm i https://github.com/MTCC-Plc/standards#cb32233
```

Either the short or long hash are fine.
